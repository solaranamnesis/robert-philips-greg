# Preface.

The following Essay originally appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for November and December 1854. I have been induced to publish it in a separate form. It has undergone both revision and addition; and the _lunar_ theory of the origin of meteorites has been noticed at some length.

The Catalogue and Tables have been constructed at considerable trouble; and as being by far the most complete yet published, may be found useful to those who collect, or take any interest in those bodies.

Through the nature and characteristics of this class of phaenomena are much better understood than formerly, the theoretical and cosmical part is still open to discussion.

# Observations on Meteorolites or Aërolites, considered Geographically, Statistically, and Cosmically; Accompanied by a Complete Catalogue of Meteoric Falls.

It is many years since any attempt has been made to give a complete list of well-authenticated meteoric falls; recently, indeed, M. Partsch of Vienna has published an interesting account, as well as catalogue, of the meteoric irons and stones in the Imperial Museum of that city; and Professor Shepard of the United States has also given us a list of the meteorites in his own collection, as well as a _thesis_ on American meteorites; but I am ignorant of anything approaching a complete or compendious catalogue of the falls of these bodies.

The accompanying catalogue has been carefully compiled from various sources*; where possible, concise particulars, not only as to date and locality, are given, but mention is also made of weights, specific gravity, appearances, etc.; and several analytical and statistical tables are added, which may not be without importance in the present as well as future consideration of this subject.

*) Such as old volumes of the Philosophical Transactions; the Philosophical Magazine; Brewster's Encyclopaedia, article "Meteorite"; Partsch's, Shepard's and Chladni's Catalogues; the volumes of the British Association; Silliman's Journal; _Comptes Rendus; Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, vol. 31.; Nicholson's Journal of Philosophy; Professor Clark's Thesis on Iron Meteoric Masses; and sundry other periodicals, both scientific and literary.

Great care has been taken to avoid erroneous dates or confusion of localities; and queries are occasionally annexed, where there wants evidence to establish fully the authenticity or correctness of the fall.

It is more especially my present object to investigate some of the results apparently indicated by these tables, constructed purposely from the general catalogue; and I shall consider the subject, first _geographically_, _i. e._ with regard to the _geographical_ distribution or deposition of aërolites on the surface of the globe; secondly, _statistically_, with reference to dates and numbers; and thirdly, if I may use the term, _cosmically_.

Considerable allowance must be made in the following, as indeed in all considerations respecting these singular bodies; but I am of opinion that the number of falls now brought together in a tabulated form will be sufficient to furnish us with some evidence, if indeed only of a negative kind, to start from. The three following tables would indicate a pretty equable occurrence of meteoric falls on the surface of our earth, a point by no means without importance. Due allowance must of course be made for various counteracting influences, such as preponderance of sea and uninhabited countries in certain latitudes, and want of historical or scientific records among particular nations, etc.
